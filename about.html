                    <p class="rvt-text-center">Single-source publishing allows the same source content to be used multiple times across different channels.  A single, central information source can be more actively managed, ensuring higher standards of content, including greater accuracy.  Publishing this content across multiple websites and applications provides greater consistency for users.
                    </p>
                    <p class="rvt-text-center">CCore uses single-sourcing for all its applications, so developers can create the best possible experiences for people across the IU digital campus.
